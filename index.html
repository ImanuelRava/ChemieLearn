	<h3>Atomic Structures</h3>
        <p>Atomic theory, a cornerstone of modern science, is a comprehensive framework that elucidates the nature and behavior of matter at the atomic level. Developed 		over centuries by eminent scientists, including Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, and others, atomic theory postulates that all matter is composed of indivisible 		particles called atoms. These atoms possess a nucleus at their center, containing positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, while negatively charged 		electrons orbit around the nucleus in discrete energy levels or orbitals. Atomic theory provides a profound understanding of the fundamental building blocks of 		matter, their interactions, and the principles that govern their behavior. It serves as the basis for explaining diverse phenomena, such as chemical reactions, the 		periodicity of elements, and the emission and absorption of light.</p>

	<h3>Electronic Structure</h3>
        <p>Electronic structure, a fundamental concept in chemistry, describes the arrangement of electrons within an atom. It plays a crucial role in understanding an 		element's chemical properties and behavior. The distribution of electrons in specific energy levels or orbitals around the nucleus determines an atom's stability 		and reactivity. Electron configuration follows the principles of the Aufbau principle, which states that electrons fill lower energy levels before occupying higher 		ones, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which mandates that each electron within a given energy level must have a unique set of quantum numbers. By studying 			electron configuration, scientists can predict an element's bonding behavior, its position in the periodic table, and its overall chemical reactivity.</p>
